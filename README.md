# Privacy_preservation_of_graph_data
Social networking is the most popular way for today’s communication. People use these sites and store
their private information in various social networking and entertainment sites like Facebook, twitter,
LinkedIn, Netflix etc. A previous research study reveals that up to 90% of user groups are concerned
about data owners sharing data concerned with them.
For the data security of these datas companies always takes some security concerns. Although basic
processes are performed on these data and thus some data anonymization processes are applied, such as
removing names or other key identifiers.But the remaining information can still be sensitive, and useful
for an attacker to re-identify users and individuals. To solve this problem, we present some useful
methods and thus we introduce noise to the original data which have been developed in order to hinder
the subsequent process of re-identification. It is a natural strategy for protecting sensitive information is
to replace identifying attributes with synthetic identifiers; we refer this as simple or naïve
anonymization.
